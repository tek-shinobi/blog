We know that all logged in users are connected to a session. This is something done for you by Django middlewares.

Similarly, for anonymous users (not logged in), every time the server receives a request, django creates a session object (meaning, an object with session_key, session_data and expire_data values). But the catch here is that you wonâ€™t see this session object in the django_session table because django sessions are [ saved only when modified ](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/sessions/#when-sessions-are-saved).

You can choose to save session every request by setting:

`SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST = True`
